= SSL Configuration

Pax Web supports SSL (https) via Jetty built
in SSL support. To get used with Jetty support you may read
http://docs.codehaus.org/display/JETTY/How+to+configure+SSL[How to
configure SSL in Jetty] and skip step 4 from that page, as the
configuration part must be done in link:Configuration.html[Pax
Web specific way].

To enable SSL support you must set the following properties:

* *org.osgi.service.http.secure.enabled* to *true*
* *org.ops4j.pax.web.ssl.keystore* to the path to the keystore to be
used. If not set the default path *${user.home}/.keystore* is used.
* *org.ops4j.pax.web.ssl.password* to the password used for keystore
integrity check. The value can be in plain text or obfuscated ( starting
with OBF: ) as described in
http://docs.codehaus.org/display/JETTY/How+to+configure+SSL#HowtoconfigureSSL-step4[step
4 of jetty docummentation]
* *org.ops4j.pax.web.ssl.keypassword* to the password used for keystore.
The value can be in plain text or obfuscated ( starting with OBF: ) as
described in
http://docs.codehaus.org/display/JETTY/How+to+configure+SSL#HowtoconfigureSSL-step4[step
4 of jetty docummentation]

You may also set the following:

* *org.osgi.service.http.port.secure* to change the port. Default is
**8443**.
